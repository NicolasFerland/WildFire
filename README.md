# WildFire

This project uses wildfire data from Kaggle and weather data from PRISM.
The goal is to create a model that can predict the occurence of fire and their size
from weather data.

Data:
https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires

Exploration of climate data.ipynb and Exploration of wildfire data.ipynb are
exploratory notebook.

Prepare data.ipynb create a numpy file Data.npy that can be used to train a machine
learning algortim.

Use neuronet.ipynb is not working yet, but the goal is to use a RNN to create the
model.
